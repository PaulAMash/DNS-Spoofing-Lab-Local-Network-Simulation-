# DNS-Spoofing-Lab-Local-Network-Simulation-
Simulated a MITM DNS spoofing attack in an isolated Linux environment using Python (dnslib) and Ettercap. Provides a script to hijack DNS queries by mapping domains to spoofed IPs, plus documentation on mitigation via static DNS entries and DNSSEC validation for lab exercises.
